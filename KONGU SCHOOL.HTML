Yes, this trust members when they were youth, they thought of the development of the society inspite of first generation entrepreneurs. They formed a trust with 25 members in the year 1982. The youth contributed not only the fund but also their precious time for the development of the program. To begin with they constructed Kalaiarangam for the public use, rented at very minimum rate. Nowadays the Kalaiarangam is given at free of cost to conduct the programmes like yoga, Karate classes. Next they took steps in the field of education. Education develops the society. Children in and around Karumathampatti had to go to Coimbatore which is 25 km away to get quality education. So the trust started a school in the year 1990, with 300 students and 12 staff members. The motto of the trust is serving the society by providing quality education. School has been proving the motto of the trust since its inception. Now the strength of the school is 3200.

            About the School
            The First batch of X Matric students scored good marks and produced 100 % result. Till now this record is maintained. Then during 1999 it was upgraded as Higher Secondary school. The school majority of the students are from rural area. Their family background is poor and their parents are uneducated. School takes complete responsibility of each child to mould them as good citizens.
